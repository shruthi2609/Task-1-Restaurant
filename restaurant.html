        <p>  There are many restaurants. Some restaurants are quick and easy and others<br>
             you stay at for a couple of hours. Some are very expensive but others are<br> 
             affordable. Not all restaurants have waiters or waitresses. Some of them<br>
             have drive-thrus and others do not. There are three main categories:<br>
             fast food restaurants, sit-down chain restaurants, and Five Star restaurants.
